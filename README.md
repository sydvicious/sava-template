# sava-template
An architecture for SwiftUI allowing asynchronous operations and dependency injection.

The developing article accompanying this project is [a Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zm8VuNXAE9PQgpRNjipUTlKKjkBUW0ELtSFXH6eUZqg/edit?usp=sharing). 
Note that this will eventually be in a hosted environment with the domain sydpolk.com,
but I am not there yet.
